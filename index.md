## Research Direction

- Urban rail big data passenger flow analysis
- Urban rail passenger flow forecast
- Dynamic fare setting for urban rail transit
- Intelligent compilation of urban rail transit operation diagram
- Optimization of operation scheme

My current research focus is on the application of short-term passenger flow forecasting in practical engineering. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Urban Rail Transit**. In a word, advanced technologies like ML positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
